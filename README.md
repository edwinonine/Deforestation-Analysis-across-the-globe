## DOCUMENTATION ON FINAL PROJECT ON DEFORESTATION ANALYSIS USING SQL

## INTRODUCTION

This is an sql project on deforestation. The project is carried out to review, analyze and derive insight to answer crucial questions on deforestation round the globe from 2019 to 2023 
and help gain deeper understanding and make data driven decision.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
deforestation is a critical environment issue that has a far-reaching consequences for ecosystem, climate, and biodiverty. 
understanding the patterns, drivers, and impacts of deforestation is essential for informed decision-making and effective conservation efforts.
we aim to identify trends, contributing factors and potential mitigation strategy.

# RESEARCH QUESTION

we aimed to find solutions to the issues facing deforestation by answering the following questions:

question 1. What are the total number of countries involved in deforestation? 

Question 2. Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000 square meter?

Question 3: Calculate average area in square miles for countries in the 'upper middle income region'. Compare the result with the rest of the income categories.

Question 4: Determine the total forest area in square km for countries in the 'high income' group. Compare result with the rest of the income categories.

Question 5: Show countries from each region(continent) having the highest total forest areas.
